can not have role from the business group and vice versa. In case it is attempted, bad request will be returned:
```

  "status": 400,

  "message": "The user cannot combine administrative and business roles!",
  "path": "/api/admin/user/role"
}
```

```
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-11",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Operation field should be GRANT or REMOVE.",

|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| A user has been successfully registered                      | CREATE_USER     |
| A user has changed the password successfully                 | CHANGE_PASSWORD |
| A user is trying to access a resource without access rights  | ACCESS_DENIED   |
| Failed authentication                                        | LOGIN_FAILED    |
| A role is granted to a user                                  | GRANT_ROLE      |
| A role has been revoked                                      | REMOVE_ROLE     |
